# Diary-of-a-Black-Magician-GB
A first try for GameBoy programming and a GB remake of my old game written in JAVA.
The audio implement should give credit to GBT_Player.

ROM file can directly downloaded here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ahch25uYsNw1oUTi0gYHht02MYX6?e=5KTiS3
It is strongly recommended to open the ROM with BGB-1.5.9

Compliling dependencies: GBDK-4.0.0, hUGEDriver
